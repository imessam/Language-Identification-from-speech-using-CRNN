- Implementation of the suggested model for Language Identification from speech in this paper 
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319151563_Language_Identification_Using_Deep_Convolutional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks
- Also a python script to extract spectograms from input audio files.
- Tested on the CommonVoice Langage dataset https://www.kaggle.com/olmatz/commonvoice-langage
- Check the notebooks for how to extract spetograms and to train the model.
- The functions to extract spectograms from audio files was from this famous script https://www.frank-zalkow.de/en/create-audio-spectrograms-with-python.html

- To run put your test files in the folder "test", they should be .wav files, and execute : python.exe run.py
